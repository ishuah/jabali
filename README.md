# Jabali

This project picks up from where [https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) left off.

This repo will contain the working project, I will open PRs on cfenollosa/os-tutorial with new chapters as the project progresses.

Next chapters:
 - Memory management
 - Write a filesystem to store files
 - Create a very simple shell
 - User mode
 - Maybe we will write a simple text editor
 - Multiple processes and scheduling
